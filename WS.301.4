Problems with traditional (Waterfall) development.
Traditional Waterfall development has several key problems: it requires
all requirements to be defined upfront, even though they often change
over time; it is inflexible and costly to modify once development has
started; testing and user feedback occur late in the process, so issues
are discovered when they are harder to fix; working software is
delivered only at the end, increasing the risk of building the wrong
product; and limited customer involvement throughout development can
lead to results that do not meet user needs.
Agile Principles
1.Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and
continuous delivery of valuable software.
2.Welcome changing requirements, even in late development. Agile
processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
3.Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a
couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4.Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the
project.
5.Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment
and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6.The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to
and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7.Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8.Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors,
developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace
indefinitely.
9.Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances
agility.
10.Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is
essential.
11.The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from
self-organizing teams.
12.At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more
effective, and then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

Agile Framework Attributes
Focus on People Expect professionalism to be used to produce high
quality outcomes.
Working Software Agile aims to deliver high-quality working
(functioning with needed functionality) software
products.
Flexibility Agility: The ability to adjust to changing conditions.
Customer Involvement Customers or User representatives are expected to be
involved, give opinions and feedback, and help to prioritize next
steps.
Multi
disciplinary
cooperating teams
Scrum teams succeed when members have T-shaped skill sets, meaning
each person has broad knowledge across many areas and deep expertise
in one or two specialties. This balance allows team members to
collaborate effectively, adapt to different tasks, and still rely on experts
when needed, which is why organizations prefer this skill-set model when
building development teams.
Trust Trust is the basic ingredient to be able to deliver the requested quality.

Methodology Framework
Scrum has no exhaustive and formal
prescriptions on how to design and plan the
work, actions, and behaviors of all players
involved in product development against time.
●Scrum is not a methodology or set of engineering
practices. It is, instead, a lightweight framework
designed to manage software and product
development. Scrum is a process framework used to
manage complex product development.
●It promotes developing products of the highest
possible value in an iterative and incremental way.
Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps
teams and organizations generate value through
adaptive solutions. It is ideal for complex product
development, and is iterative and incremental.
