Scrum - Artifacts Workbook
Definition of Done
Definition Assessment/Checklist allows work to be defined as “Done.”
Defined by the development team.
Varies per team: Understandable for the team.
Helps to define how many items can be selected for Sprint.
More mature teams: More stringent criteria.
Purpose Make themselves more efficient.
Deliver better customer service.
Increase sales and profitability.
Take advantage of a market opportunity.
Spur growth.
Become more competitive.
Product Backlog
Definition The Product Backlog is used to document the wants and needs for “stuff,”
which is prioritized by how much value it is to the business.
Different people in the business will ask for different “stuff.”
Not everything that is asked for has value to the business.
Some things may be valuable only to the person asking rather than to the entire
business.
By prioritizing value to the business, non-value add or less-value add items are
eliminated or moved to the bottom of the list.
The list is worked based on what the highest priority or value is to the business.
Purpose The Product Backlog is an ordered list of "requirements" that is maintained for a
product. It contains Product Backlog Items that are ordered by the Product
Owner based on considerations like risk, business value, dependencies, date
needed, etc. The features added to the backlog are commonly written in story
format (See terminology below). The product backlog is the “What” that will be
built, sorted in the relative order it should be built in. It is open and editable by
anyone, but the Product Owner is ultimately responsible for ordering the stories
on the backlog for the Development Team.
The Product Backlog, and business value of each listed item is the
responsibility of the Product Owner. The estimated effort to complete each
backlog item is, however, determined by the Development Team. The team
contributes by estimating Items and User-Stories, either in Story-points or in
estimated hours
Ordering • Ordered list of all user requests/requirements.
Product
Backlog
Grooming
• Product Backlog is constantly re-evaluated and re-ordered, and items
added or removed in a process are called Product Backlog Grooming.
Large Items • Very large PBIs are called Epics.
○ Epics are broken down into smaller digestible chunks before being
considered for work being done.
PBIs • Each entry is called a Product Backlog Item (PBI).
Sprint Backlog
Definition ● Sprint Backlog Items (SBI).
○ Ordered list of requirements.
● Considerations:
○ Risk.
○ Dependencies.
○ Deadline.
● Business Value:
○ Value-Orientation vs. Result-Orientation
Purpose The Sprint Backlog is the list of work the Development Team must
address during the next sprint. The list is derived by selecting
stories/features from the top of the product backlog until the
Development Team feels it has enough work to fill the sprint. This is
done by the Development Team asking "Can we also do this?" and
adding stories/features to the sprint backlog. The Development Team
should keep in mind the velocity of its previous Sprints (total story
points completed from each of the last sprints stories) when selecting
stories/features for the new sprint, and use this number as a guideline
of how much "effort" they can complete.
The stories/features are broken down into tasks by the Development
Team, which, as a best practice, should normally be between four and
sixteen hours of work. With this level of detail the Development Team
understands exactly what to do, and potentially, anyone can pick a
task from the list. Tasks on the sprint backlog are never assigned;
rather, tasks are signed up for by the team members as needed
during the Daily Scrum, according to the set priority and the
Development Team member skills. This promotes self-organization of
the Development Team, and developer buy-in.
The sprint backlog is the property of the Development Team, and all
included estimates are provided by the Development Team. Often an
accompanying Task Board is used to see and change the state of the
tasks of the current sprint, like “to do”, “in progress” and “done”.
Source of items ● List of work to be performed during this Sprint.
● Created for the current sprint by selecting items from the
product backlog during the sprint planning session.
● Sprint Backlog is listed on the Task Board.
How are items chosen? ● Prioritized with a plan for accomplishment
● Sprint Backlog items are broken down into tasks with each task
having a planned maximum duration of two days.
What does value
orientation vs. results
orientation mean?
• Tasks are tracked progressively to completion.
• Task Board is re-evaluated every day during the daily standup.
Task Board • Interactive listing of work to be/being performed during Sprint.
• Used daily to identify workflow.
• Displayed in a common work area.
Sprint Backlog Item
specific piece of work selected from the Product Backlog that the
Scrum Team commits to completing during a sprint. Each item is
clearly defined, actionable, and contributes directly to achieving the
sprint goal, typically including tasks, user stories, or bug fixes that can
be completed within the sprint timeframe.
Burndown Chart
Purpose The Burn-down chart provides a daily measure of work remaining in an iteration.
The sprint Burn-down chart is a publicly displayed chart showing remaining work
in the sprint backlog.
How is it
updated?
Updated every day, it gives a simple view of the sprint progress. It also provides
quick visualizations for reference.
How often is
it used?
• Assessed daily.
Significance? There are also other types of burn-down, for example the Release Burn-down
chart that shows the amount of work left to complete the target commitment for a
Product Release (normally spanning through multiple iterations) and the
alternative release Burndown chart, which basically does the same, but clearly
shows scope changes to Release Content, by resetting the baseline.
User Stories
Definition ● Describes what the user needs to do in
the job function.
Purpose ● Used as the basis for defining the
function of the business system.
● Used as a basis for requirements
gathering.
Format Epics are broken down into smaller stories, and
then broken down further into tasks.
Source
Based on relative effort.
• Show only the relative size of the item -
not the time to complete.
• Teams pick a simple, agreed-upon basis.
Attributes for completeness • acceptance criteria
• any defined conditions
Estimation
Story
Points
Choosing enough work to fill up a full sprint:
• Based on relative effort.
• Show only the relative size of the item - not the time to complete.
• Teams pick a simple, agreed-upon basis.
Used for Estimation Activities.
Planning
Poker
Determining the amount of work for each
Product Backlog Item
Based on the Fibonacci Sequence:
• Each numbered card represents the amount of work the team member believes
this item represents.
• Each development team member is issued one set of cards.
• If, when hands are shown, there is not a clear agreement on the amount of work
involved, high and low bidders will explain why they chose that bid.
• The team will revote until they reach a consensus.
Fibonacci
Sequence
• The Fibonacci sequence is a type of series where each number is the sum
of the two that precede it. 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55
