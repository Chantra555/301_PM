Sprint definition
A **sprint** is a short, fixed period of time during which a team works to complete specific tasks
or goals. In **Agile and Scrum project management**, sprints usually last 1–4 weeks, focusing on
a defined set of work called the sprint backlog, with the aim of delivering a usable result by the
end. Outside of project management, the term can also refer to a brief burst of intense effort,
such as running a short-distance race at maximum speed or quickly completing a task.
Determination of length of sprint.
Sprints are limited to one calendar month. When a Sprint’s horizon is too long the definition of
what is being built may change, complexity may rise, and risk may increase. Sprints enable
predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Sprint Goal at least
every calendar month. Sprints also limit risk to one calendar month of cost.
Sprint Rituals
Sprint Planning Meeting One of the most popular ways of
estimating user stories is by playing
estimation poker, sometimes called
Planning Poker. This is a game to
determine user story size and to build
consensus with the development team
members.
To play it, you need a deck of cards with
numbers of the Fibonacci sequence on
the cards.
Some rules to follow:
Product Owner reads out high-priority
user story.
Each player selects a card representing
estimate of effort involved
All players return their cards
simultaneously.
Discuss outcomes and translate size to
time needed to get it ‘done.’
Story Points provide information on the
Velocity of a team
Estimation Estimating is always an approximation
Periodically re-estimate Story Points
Triangulation – Planning Poker
Relate estimates: 2 pt story should be
half of 4 pt etc.
Do we still agree on meaning of a story
point
Precision decreases with size of story
Blind Estimation requires quite some
background work
Affinity Estimation can be done in
relative short time
Write your user stories on post-its
Take one min to agree on category:
XS/S/M/XL/too large
Take 30 seconds per user story to
categorize
Product Owner reviews
3 types of estimation When this occurs Unit of measure
Blind Estimation Estimate product backlog
Decompose reference story
Identify team capacity
Estimate team velocity
Affinity Estimating Quickly categorize user stories
Apply estimates to categories

Daily Standup
Purpose
The Development Team uses the Daily Stand-up to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and
to inspect how progress is trending toward completing the work in the Sprint Backlog. The Daily
Scrum optimizes the probability that the Development Team will meet the Sprint Goal. Every day,
the Development Team should understand how it intends to work together as a self-organizing
team to accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated Increment by the end of the Sprint.
The Development Team or team members often meet immediately after the Daily Scrum for
detailed discussions, or to adapt, or replan, the rest of the Sprint’s work.
The Scrum Master asks the questions. Same place and time every day. For synchronization, not
problem-solving. A short meeting may be held after the Scrum meeting to resolve issues (only
attended by relevant team members). Time box: 15 minutes daily. It works best if you do it in the
early hours of a day.
3 Questions
What have you do since the last meeting?
What are you planning to do before the next meeting?
Do you experience any obstacles?
Rules
Pair Programming
In Pair programming, two developers work together on the code. Both sit at the same computer
and create one requirement. They pass the keyboard and mouse back and forth to collaborate.
This way they catch errors easily.
Ensure that everyone knows what the code does.
Collective code ownership!
Two team members work together in single task.
Driver and navigator
Constant reflection (real time reviewing).
Reduction of noise.

Sprint Retrospective Meeting
The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for
improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint. The Scrum Master encourages the Scrum Team to
improve, within the Scrum process framework, its development process and practices to make it more
effective and enjoyable for the next Sprint. During each Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team plans ways to
increase product quality by adapting the Definition of “Done” as appropriate.
